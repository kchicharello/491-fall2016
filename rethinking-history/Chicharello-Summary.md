Jenkins brings up questions about the essence of history, and answers these questions in regards to what is history.
He discusses Truth as Jenkins calls, a "created concept", and the arbitrariness of truth within history. Fact and interpretation depend on the consensus of the majority.
Bias to Jenkins is interpretation about the past, and this interpretation can be mistaken for truth by one ideology, but be seen as bias by another.
We can never truly empathize with those who lived in the past, because all things gets lost in translation. This loss of truth in translation is a central problem in history.
Historians, should come to terms with the fact that their profession may be flawed, and may have to come to terms with how certain they can be that their profession is an objective and truthful producer of knowledge.
