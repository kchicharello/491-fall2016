1.	Will it ever be possible to create an un-biased history? 
2.	Is history just a copy of all histories that came before? So, basically copies of copies? 
3.	What is considered good history? The history that the majority agrees on? Or the most complete history? 
4.	What can history do to protect itself from ideological history and propaganda history? Can it ever truly be free of ideological influence? 
5.	Can history rely of scientific fact rather than unreachable truths to create an unbiased history? Or are we stuck forever stuck with conjecture and what ifs?
